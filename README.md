AutoRenalCyst_MR
==========================

The "AutoRenalCyst_MR" package consists of image processing tools to facilitate cystic organ research. An automated segmentation approach for follow-up MRIs of PKD patients is implemented in the AutoRegSegTKV source code. This software is made available so that it may be of use to the scientific and clinical communities. The source codes can be run independently from the command line, or run from the viewer.

Also included are methods for preprocessing of MRI scans for intra- and inter-slice intensity correction, as well as inter-slice motion (corrections for interleaved/multiple breath-hold acquisitions).

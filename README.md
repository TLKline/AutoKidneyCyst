AutoKidneyCyst
==========================

The "AutoKidneyCyst" package consists of the source code for the research study, "Automatic Semantic Segmentation of Kidney Cysts in MR Images of Patients Affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease." The study developed a fully automated tool for measurement of cyst volumes from MR images of patients affected by ADPKD. This software is made available so that it may be of use to the scientific and clinical communities. The source codes can be run independently from the command line.
